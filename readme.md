<h2 align="center">Employee Management System - Web</h2>

<p align="justify">Employee management system is an web application based system, having two applications developed, one for employers to manage employee details and another for login and registration. Every organization whether government or private uses an information system to store data of their staff. However, in Maharashtra it is found that many colleges use registers to keep a record of their staff. However, there are many advanced technology systems available that can do this work but they all are costly for these low level industries. So we made a system for solving this problems for them at a cheaper cost. This system will help in user registration and login using Sevarth ID of employee and shows details of them. It saves lots of time. So that government can access Details of employees working in different collages.
We call Employee Management System as EMS</p>

What is CodeIgniter
###################

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.
